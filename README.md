# typesense-rails

This is a fork of [Algolia's Rails integration](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-rails), adapted to work with Typesense. 

It is mostly complete, but it needs testing with multiple Rails apps and some tweaking before we can publish it officially. We're looking for contributors to help with this. If you're interested, please install the `adaptations` branch of this gem in your Rails app, give it a spin and then open issues in the issue tracker with feedback. We'd definitely appreciate PRs to address these issues as well. 

Please join the #contributions channel in our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/typesense-community/shared_invite/zt-mx4nbsbn-AuOL89O7iBtvkz136egSJg) and introduce yourself, if you'd like to collaborate.
